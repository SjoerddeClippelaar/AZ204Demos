# AZ-204 supporting code samples project

## Goal
This is a repository to accompany the Microsoft AZ-204 course (Developing solutions for Microsoft Azure).
It was created by Erik Verboom to practice with AZ-204 and to support teaching the course.

The projects are designed to help in two ways:
- showing examples of how to programmatically provision the products taught in the course
- quickly setting up testing environments to see the products in action
